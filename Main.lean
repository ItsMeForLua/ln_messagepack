# `ln-messagepack` Demonstration

This file serves as a demo for the `ln-messagepack` library.
It demonstrates how to:
1. Define a custom data structure (`User`).
2. Implement the `MsgPackEncode` and `MsgPackDecode` typeclasses for it.
3. Perform round-trip serialization and deserialization for various types.

This file is not part of the core of library itself, but is an example of how a
user might interact with the public API.

To run the demo executable, you must CD into the library root, and then run `lake exe messagepack`.
-/

-- By convention, users should only need to import the library's main module, like so:

open ln_messagepack

/-- A basic structure to demonstrate custom type serialization. -/
structure User where
  /-- A unique identifier for the user. -/
  id : Nat
  /-- The user's name. -/
  name : String
  deriving BEq, Repr

-- Add a ToString instance so IO.println knows how to print a User.
instance : ToString User where
  toString u := toString (repr u)

/--
Teaches `ln-messagepack` how to encode a `User`.
We serialize a `User` as a 2-element MessagePack array: `[id, name]`.
-/
instance : MsgPackEncode User where
  encode u := .arr #[
    encode u.id,
    encode u.name
  ]

/--
Teaches `ln-messagepack` how to decode a `User`.
The decoder expects the same 2-element array structure used for encoding.
If the `MsgPackValue` is not an array of the correct shape, decoding will fail.
-/
instance : MsgPackDecode User where
  decode
    | .arr #[idVal, nameVal] => do
      let id ← decode idVal
      let name ← decode nameVal
      pure { id, name }
    | _ => none

/--
The main entry point for the demo executable.

This function runs a series of round trip tests, and prints the results
to the console. It provides a quick visual confirmation that the core
features of the library are working as expected.

  -- (2) Custom type round trip
  IO.println "\n[2] Custom Type (User) Round Trip"
  let user : User := { id := 123, name := "Alice" }

  | none =>
    IO.println "❌ Failure: Decoding failed."

  -- (3) List round trip
  IO.println "\n[3] List Round Trip"
  let xs : List Nat := [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  IO.println s!"Original: {xs}"
  let encodedListBytes := encodeToMsgPackBytes xs

      IO.println "✅ Success: Decoded list matches original."
    else
      IO.println "❌ Failure: Mismatch!"
  | none =>
    IO.println "❌ Failure: Decoding failed."

  -- (4) Array round trip
  IO.println "\n[4] Array Round Trip"
  let arr : Array Bool := #[true, false, true]
  IO.println s!"Original: {arr}"
  let encodedArrBytes := encodeToMsgPackBytes arr

      IO.println "✅ Success: Decoded array matches original."
    else
      IO.println "❌ Failure: Mismatch!"
  | none =>
    IO.println "❌ Failure: Decoding failed."

  -- (5) Timestamp (Extension Type) round trip
  IO.println "\n[5] Timestamp Round Trip"
  let originalTimestamp : Timestamp := { sec := 1672531200, nsec := 500000000 }
  IO.println s!"Original: {originalTimestamp}"
